I started contributing to this project around the start of 2019 when I was short on personal programming projects, so began searching for a project I could contribute to. Growing up, I used to play a lot of Dance Dance Revolution at my arcade before they closed. I don't get the chance to play as much today, so instead, I try to make time to work on this game so it can still be enjoyed. It's not so easy with life going on, but I try to come back.


## Major Contributions
- [Pull Request #445](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/pull/455) - Organized source files, Removed unused files, Moved libraries
    - Before this PR, all source files were in the same `src/` directory.
- [Pull Request #481](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/pull/481) - Completely rewrite of CMake build system
    - The original CMake build system was a mess - Difficult to modify, and difficult to understand.
- [Pull Request #780](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/pull/780) - Improved CI with GitHub Actions
    - This one is semi-major, because it wasn't a huge change, but it made out developer lives a lot easier, and I'm proud of it.
- [Pull Request #882](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/pull/882) - üí• Improve Crash Handling
    - This one is major because finding out why our program crashed was a pain point (we only had log files). With this, we have stacktraces on every thread, and we can see the exact line of code that caused the crash.
