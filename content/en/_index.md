Hey there! My name is James. I'm a programmer, student, and EMT. When I'm not working or studying, I work on open-source projects and improve my development skillset with a focus on performance and optimization!

This website is a window into my past projects and a glimpse into what I plan to do next. Feel free to explore and make yourself at home!
