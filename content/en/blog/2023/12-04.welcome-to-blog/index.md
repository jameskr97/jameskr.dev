Hi, I’m James! I like writing code, specifically looking at performance and optimization of low level code. Though, I also enjoy writing web projects, and writing projects that are useful for others who like to self-host. This will the place where I most about my ideas, side projects, and research notes. While I may occasionally write about something I'm already experienced in, I think it would be better to write about something I'm learning about.

I did give blog writing a first attempt in 2020 with my [Using Google Crashpad]({{< ref "blog/2020/09-12.using-google-crashpad/index.md" >}}) post, but shortly after I wrote that, I got my first full-time job on an ambulance, and **quickly** found out how much time and energy that kind of job takes from someone. _(it's still the best job I've had up until this point in my life)._

Though, my life situation has changed (I've decided to return to traditional higher education), and I decided it was about time to properly setup a space where I can post my writing.

So, welcome to my writing place!
